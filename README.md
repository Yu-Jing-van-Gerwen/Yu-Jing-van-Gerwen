My name is Yu Jing van Gerwen and I am studying <a href="https://www.hva.nl/opleidingen/ad-frontend-design-and-development?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvpy5BhDTARIsAHSilykElpKWGA5rnxZlu2ETEpY9xJeN-_hlOL3_IH_1Y0Q8928FYlYelJcaAqRpEALw_wcB">Frontend design & development</a> at the HvA <a href="https://github.com/fdnd">@fdnd</a>.


In my first year, I learned best practices in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also gained experience with EJS, Node.js, Express, and Directus to initialize a connection to the Directus CMS database.
<br>
In my second year, I am currently learning frameworks, such as SvelteKit and Eleventy.

Here you can see all my projects, and my <a href="https://i-love-web-dun.vercel.app/">portfolio </a> provides more details about each one.
